# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project is a personal playground for practicing and implementing data structures and algorithms. I use the book [Introduction to Algorithms][2], commonly known as _CLRS_, as a primary, but not exclusive, reference. Not all data structures and algorithms implemented here are from that book, however.

> Beyond _CLRS_, I use a wide variety of sources for furthering my understanding of the subject. References to such resources are provided at the end of this document.

## Approach

Though I try to provide generally efficient implementations, that's not the focus of this project. This project is strictly a learning resource first and foremost for me and then for whomever might find it useful. To that end, I try to make implementations as simple and standalone as possible instead of creating complex hierarchies and using cunning language features to minimize the amount of code written. As a result there's not a whole lot in the way of code reuse. For the same reason, whenever needed, arrays are copied manually instead of using `System.arraycopy()`. You also won't find any of new Java 8 features like Lambdas and Streams.

As I explore the book and other resources, I'll keep adding my implementations. At some point, I'll also start adding my solutions to algorithmic problems described in many resources listed below or from elsewhere on the 'net.


## Important Note
Please note that many data structures and algorithms can be implemented only in so many different ways. Therefore, similarity between my implementations and other implementations (including, but not limited to, implementations from the resources referenced below) are inevitable. Any similarities, partial or whole, are un-intentional and are artifacts of studying from different resources. In any case, all credits belong to the resources listed in references.
