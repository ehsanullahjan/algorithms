# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project is a personal playground for practicing and implementing data structures and algorithms. I use the book [Introduction to Algorithms][2], commonly known as _CLRS_, as a primary, but not exclusive, reference.

> Beyond _CLRS_, I use a wide variety of resources for furthering my understanding of the subject (see references).

## Approach

Alhough I try to provide generally efficient implementations, that's not the focus of this project. This project is strictly a learning resource first and foremost for me and then for whomever might find it useful.

To that end, I try to make implementations simple and explicit, avoiding complex class hierarchies and cunning language features. As a result there's not a whole lot in the way of code reuse. When needed, arrays are copied manually instead of using `System.arraycopy()`. Hardly any built-in Java library implementations are used, if any at all. You also won't find any new Java 8 features like Lambdas and Streams.

## Looking Forward

As I explore the book and other resources, I'll keep adding my implementations. I'll also be adding my solutions to algorithmic problems described in many resources listed below or from elsewhere on the 'net.


## Important Note

Many data structures and algorithms can be implemented only in so many different ways. Therefore, similarity between my implementations and other implementations (including, but not limited to, implementations from the resources referenced below) are inevitable. Any similarities, partial or whole, are un-intentional and are artifacts of studying from different resources. In any case, all credits belong to the resources listed below.
